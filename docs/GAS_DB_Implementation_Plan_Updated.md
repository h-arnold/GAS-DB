## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development of the GAS DB MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The plan divides the implementation into discrete, testable sections, each with specific objectives and test cases that must pass before progressing to the next section. So far, four core sections have been successfully completed.

The implementation will use Google Apps Script with clasp for testing, and assumes permissions to read and write to Google Drive files and folders. The plan focuses on delivering core functionality while ensuring code quality, maintainability, and adherence to the requirements specified in the PRD and Class Diagrams.

## ✅ Section 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

### Summary ✅

Section 1 successfully established the development environment, project structure, core utility classes, and the TDD framework. Key utilities like `GASDBLogger`, `ErrorHandler`, and `IdGenerator` were implemented and thoroughly tested. The test framework, including assertion utilities and a test runner, is fully operational.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ Clasp environment configured with an organized project structure.
- ✅ Comprehensive test framework (`AssertionUtilities.js`, `TestRunner.js`) implemented.
- ✅ Core utilities (`GASDBLogger.js`, `ErrorHandler.js`, `IdGenerator.js`) created and tested.
- ✅ `GASDBLogger` (renamed from `Logger`) provides robust, configurable logging.
- ✅ `test-runner.sh` script enhanced for reliable test execution with clasp.
- ✅ All 16 test cases for this section are passing (100%).

**Files Created:**

- Core: `GASDBLogger.js`, `ErrorHandler.js`, `IdGenerator.js`, `AssertionUtilities.js`, `TestRunner.js`
- Tests: `Section1Tests.js`, `TestExecution.js`
- Config: `package.json`, `appsscript.json`, `clasp.json`
- Automation: `test-runner.sh`
- Docs: `Section1_README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`

This section provides the foundational tools and infrastructure for subsequent development.

## ✅ Section 2: ScriptProperties Master Index (COMPLETED)

### Summary ✅

Section 2 focused on implementing the `MasterIndex` class, which manages collection metadata and virtual locking using Google Apps Script's `ScriptProperties`. This component is crucial for efficient metadata access and preventing concurrent modification conflicts.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ `MasterIndex.js` (523 lines) implemented, providing methods for reading/writing to `ScriptProperties`, collection metadata management, virtual locking, and conflict detection/resolution.
- ✅ Integrated `ScriptLock` for robust locking.
- ✅ All 16 test cases covering index operations, locking, and conflict detection are passing (100%).

**Files Created:**

- Core: `MasterIndex.js`
- Tests: `Section2Tests.js`
- Updated: `TestExecution.js`, `test-runner.sh`

The `MasterIndex` provides a fast and reliable way to manage database metadata, minimizing direct Drive API calls for such operations.

## ✅ Section 3: File Service and Drive Integration (COMPLETED)

### Summary ✅

Section 3 successfully implemented the `FileService` and `FileOperations` classes, enabling robust interaction with Google Drive for storing and managing database files. Drive API integration is fully functional, and all related bugs have been resolved.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ `FileOperations.js` (501 lines) created for direct Drive API interactions (read, write, create, delete files) with logging and retry logic.
- ✅ `FileService.js` (223 lines) implemented as the primary interface for optimized file operations, including batching, caching, and circuit breaker patterns.
- ✅ Google Drive API access fully resolved and functional.
- ✅ All 36 test cases, covering basic file operations, advanced features (caching, circuit breaker), error handling, and integration, are passing (100%).
- ✅ Resolved issues including malformed JSON error handling and data structure preservation.

**Files Created:**

- Core: `FileOperations.js`, `FileService.js`
- Tests: `Section3Tests.js`
- Updated: `appsscript.json` (OAuth scopes), `TestExecution.js`

This section ensures reliable and optimized data persistence on Google Drive.

## ✅ Section 4: Database and Collection Management (COMPLETED & REFACTORED)

### Summary ✅

Section 4 implemented the core `Database` and `DatabaseConfig` classes. Initially, `Database` handled index file management and collection operations directly. A significant post-completion refactoring shifted primary responsibility for collection metadata and management to the `MasterIndex` (from Section 2), with the `Database` class now delegating these tasks. This optimizes performance by leveraging `ScriptProperties` and uses Drive-based index files mainly for backup and migration.

**Key Achievements & Architecture:**

- ✅ `DatabaseConfig.js` implemented for configuration validation and defaults.
- ✅ `Database.js` implemented for high-level database operations.
- ✅ **Post-Completion Refactoring**:
  - `MasterIndex` is now the authoritative source for collection metadata and IDs.
  - `Database` class methods (`collection()`, `createCollection()`, `listCollections()`, `dropCollection()`, `initialise()`) now delegate to `MasterIndex`.
  - Drive-based index files are used for explicit backup (`backupIndexToDrive()`) and recovery/migration.
  - This significantly reduces Drive API calls for routine operations.
- ✅ All 18 streamlined test cases (post-refactoring) covering `DatabaseConfig`, `Database` initialization, collection management delegation, index file structure (including corruption handling), and `MasterIndex` integration are passing (100%).

**Updated Design (Post-Refactoring):**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Database {
        - indexFileId : string
        - collections : Map
        - _masterIndex : MasterIndex
        + initialise()
        + createCollection(name)
        + collection(name)
        + dropCollection(name)
        + listCollections()
        + backupIndexToDrive()
        - _findExistingIndexFile()
        - _createIndexFile()
        - _validateCollectionName()
    }

    class MasterIndex {
        - _data : object
        + addCollection(name, metadata)
        + removeCollection(name)
        + getCollection(name)
        + getCollections()
        + isInitialised()
        + save()
    }

    Database --> MasterIndex : uses
```

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

- ✅ Faster operations due to minimized Drive API calls.
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns: `MasterIndex` for metadata, `Database` for high-level operations.
- ✅ Single source of truth for collection data (`MasterIndex`).
- ✅ Robust backup mechanism via Drive index file.

**Files Created/Updated:**

- Core: `DatabaseConfig.js`, `Database.js`
- Tests: `Section4Tests.js` (reflecting 18 tests post-refactoring)
- Updated: `UnifiedTestExecution.js`, `TestExecution.js`, `TestRunner.js`

This refactored architecture provides a more efficient and maintainable foundation for the database.
