## Test-Driven Development Process

For each section, the development process will follow these steps:

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Create test cases for the section's functionality
   - Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)

2. **Implement Functionality**
   - Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Focus on functionality, not optimization

3. **Refactor Code**
   - Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests
   - Optimize for readability and performance

4. **Verify Completion Criteria**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Validate against section objectives
   - Document any issues or limitations

5. **Proceed to Next Section**
   - Only move to the next section when current section is complete
   - Maintain regression testing for previous sections

## Testing with Clasp

The implementation will use clasp for testing with Google Apps Script. Key considerations include:

1. **Test Environment**
   - Create isolated test environments in Drive
   - Clean up test data after tests
   - Use unique identifiers for test resources

2. **Test Runner**
   - Implement custom test runner for Apps Script
   - Support setup and teardown operations
   - Provide clear test reporting

3. **Mocking and Stubbing**
   - Mock Drive API for unit testing
   - Stub PropertiesService for controlled testing
   - Create test doubles for external dependencies
   - Mock component dependencies for isolated testing

4. **Permissions**
   - Tests will require Drive read/write permissions
   - Tests will require ScriptProperties access
   - Tests should run with the same permissions as the production code

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Google Apps Script Limitations**
   - 6-minute execution time limit
   - Synchronous execution model
   - Limited memory allocation
   - API quotas and rate limits

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize Drive API calls through FileOperations/FileCache separation
   - Optimize in-memory operations
   - Implement efficient data structures
   - Use dirty checking to reduce writes

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error types
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Ensure proper cleanup after errors
   - Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all classes and methods
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document limitations and constraints
   - Include performance considerations

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the GAS DB MVP using Test-Driven Development. By breaking the implementation into discrete, testable sections with clear objectives and completion criteria, the plan ensures that each component is thoroughly tested and meets requirements before integration.

The focus on TDD ensures code quality and maintainability, while the section-by-section approach allows for incremental progress and validation. The plan addresses the unique challenges of Google Apps Script development, including execution limits, API constraints, and cross-instance coordination.

The separation of concerns in Collection and FileService components improves code maintainability and testability while remaining MVP-focused. This approach provides a solid foundation for future enhancements without overcomplicating the initial implementation.

Following this plan will result in a robust, well-tested implementation of the GAS DB library that meets all core requirements specified in the PRD and Class Diagrams.
