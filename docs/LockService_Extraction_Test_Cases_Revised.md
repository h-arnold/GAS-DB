Here’s my diagnosis of the red-flag issues that are cascading through your DbLockService suites:

2.  **Hard-coded master-index key vs test-injected key**  
    Your service always reads/writes the ScriptProperties entry under `'GASDB_MASTER_INDEX'`, yet the LockService test harness is mounting everything under a test key (e.g. `"GASDB_TEST_LOCKSERVICE_MASTER_INDEX"`).  Without a way to inject or override the master-index key into `DbLockService`, your real-environment and MasterIndex integration tests will be out of sync with the setup/teardown routines.

3.  **Undefined `LOCKSERVICE_TEST_DATA` constant**  
    The real-environment integration suite references `LOCKSERVICE_TEST_DATA` but never defines/imports it.  That’s a straight ReferenceError and must be added to the test scaffolding (or imported from a shared test-data module).

4.  **ScriptLock semantics and concurrency**  
    -  Tests that simulate a timeout on `waitLock` depend on throwing from the real GAS lock; but in Apps Script the lock is always acquired by the same script, so you won’t get a timeout unless you block it in another thread.  The test harness probably stubs `waitLock` to throw, but because of (1) it never reaches that stub.  
    -  “Concurrent” script-lock tests in the real-env suite may need you to call `tryLock` rather than `waitLock`, or to create fully independent instances to mirror two simultaneous GAS executions.  

In summary, the very first blocker is the missing `_validateLockServiceAvailable` helper; once that’s added (and made a no-op or an actual environment check), your `acquireScriptLock` path will execute, catch and rethrow `LOCK_TIMEOUT`, and your release path will be exercised correctly.  After that, you’ll still need to align your master-index key with the tests’ expectations and define the missing `LOCKSERVICE_TEST_DATA` fixture.
