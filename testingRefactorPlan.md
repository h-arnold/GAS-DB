# GAS-DB Testing Framework Refactor Plan

## 1. Summary of Current State
- Multiple overlapping test execution files: `TestExecution.js`, `TestRunner.js`, `Un## 7. Benefits

- Easier onboarding for new contributors.
- Clearer, more maintainable test code.
- Reduced duplication and improved resource management.
- Consistent, reliable test execution and reporting.
- **100% functionality preservation** - No existing capabilities lost.
- **Dramatic simplification** - From 4 framework files to 1.
- **Enhanced debugging** - Better error messages and resource tracking.

## 8. Next StepsstExecution.js`, and `AssertionUtilities.js`.
- Test suites and lifecycle hooks are present, but the structure can be confusing for new contributors.
- Test discovery and execution are section-based, with some redundancy in setup/teardown logic.

## 2. Problems Identified
- **Redundancy**: Overlapping responsibilities between test execution files.
- **Complexity**: Multiple entry points and unclear separation of concerns.
- **Onboarding Difficulty**: New contributors may struggle to know where to add or run tests.
- **Resource Management**: Cleanup and setup logic is sometimes duplicated or handled inconsistently.

## 3. Refactor Goals
- Simplify the test framework structure for clarity and maintainability.
- Ensure single responsibility for each component (runner, assertions, reporting).
- Make it easy to add, discover, and run tests.
- Centralise and standardise environment setup/teardown.
- Retain all current features (sectioned tests, lifecycle hooks, individual test running).
